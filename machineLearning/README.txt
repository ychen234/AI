Collaborators (NetID):
	Yaozhong Huang (yhuang94)
	Qianqian Gu (qgu3)
	Yihe Chen (ychen234)

To run the program, you need to use the command-line:

------------------Set Up---------------------------
cd your_directroy/242project4_final/CSC242_Project4/src
javac $(find . -name "*.java")
*this step is necessary to compile the .java files
**Before the start, make sure that you are in the correct directory.

----------------Linear Classifier--------------------------------
Run the command and the output will provide the regression model
For each graph, we plot 10000 steps of weights update.
Fixed Learning rate alpha is set to 0.95 for non-decaying tests, and 0 for decaying case.
In the output, we also showed the fixed learning rate, the number of updates and the updated accuracy after each step.
All graphs are generated by excel with data resulted in command line

---------Neural Networks----------------
We implemented the methods in learn.nn.core
